print('''because people dont understand the birth and death ratio so enormously birth rate is increasing day by day 
      'more than death rate and this tells about the literacy rate of our country .people are not that aware of the 
      terms of population balance status.''')
print('''And these all birth rate effects directly our economic base because people are not earning that much too
at least get a proper meal of three times then how they would be able to educate their child .There in our country 
survival is big issue so education and literacy rate are not even in priority list.''')
